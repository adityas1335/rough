I understand the issue. The auto-export feature is triggering when fixing invalid JSON. Let's modify the handleJsonChange function in the json-editor.tsx file to prevent automatic CSV export when fixing invalid JSON.

components/json-editor.tsx
Now the JSON editor will update the data only when valid JSON is entered, but won't automatically export the CSV file. You can use the Export CSV button when you want to save your changes.

i hope removing this line :
// Auto-save as CSV
const csvContent = [["Text", "JSON"], ...updatedData.map((row) => [row.plainText, row.json])]
const csv = Papa.unparse(csvContent)
const blob = new Blob([csv], { type: "text/csv;charset=utf-8;" })
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
const link = document.createElement("a")
link.setAttribute("href", url)
link.setAttribute("download", "auto_saved_data.csv")
link.style.visibility = "hidden"
document.body.appendChild(link)
link.click()
document.body.removeChild(link)

 does not effect my other feature. and it is only effect the my problem when auto-export feature triggering for fixing invalid JSON?

Yes, removing that auto-export code block will only affect the automatic CSV export that was happening when fixing invalid JSON. The manual export feature (using the "Export CSV" button) will continue to work normally since that uses a different function (exportData).

The change we made only removes the automatic CSV export that was happening specifically during JSON validation fixes. All other features, including:

Manual CSV export
JSON validation
JSON editing
Data persistence
Row selection
JSON formatting
Will continue to work as expected. The only difference is that now when you fix an invalid JSON, it won't automatically trigger a CSV download.

I'll help you modify the JSON editor to show errors while editing JSON, not just when it's invalid initially. We'll update the handleJsonChange function in json-editor.tsx:

components/json-editor.tsx
This change will:

Show real-time JSON validation errors while editing
Update the row's validation state immediately
Display the specific JSON error message
Clear the error when the JSON becomes valid

when we are click on export CSV. it will export file name with "Annotated_Data_{date}_{time}" where date and time will be currect date and time at when we are click on export CSV button.

I'll help you modify the exportData function to include the current date and time in the exported CSV filename.

components/json-editor.tsx
Now when you click the "Export CSV" button, the file will be downloaded with a name like "Annotated_Data_2024-03-13_14-30-45.csv" (example date and time format).

Sometimes we accidentally close the browser without checking open tabs, which can lead to losing all our unsaved work. To prevent this, I want to implement a feature that automatically exports the file before the browser is closed. so, whatever we edited those will be exported.

I'll help you implement a feature that automatically exports the CSV file before the browser closes. We'll use the beforeunload event to trigger the export.

components/json-editor.tsx
This change will:

Add a beforeunload event listener when the component mounts
Trigger an automatic CSV export when the browser is about to close
Use the same date-time naming format as the manual export
Only attempt to export if there is data to save

I'll help you add row status indicators to show which rows have been visited (yellow) and edited (green). We'll modify the row number circle in the JSON editor to reflect these states.

components/json-editor.tsx
This will:

Show yellow circles for visited rows
Show green circles for edited rows
Keep the default style for unvisited rows
Persist the states during the session
The colors will be lighter in light mode and darker in dark mode for better visibility.

visited status is showing but if i am doing any editing in json then that status is not showing. whenever i change any thing in json of any row then the row number circle will became green.

I notice that the issue is in the handleJsonChange function where we need to update the editedRows state. Let's fix this by moving the setEditedRows call outside the catch block so it's triggered for any JSON changes, valid or invalid.

components/json-editor.tsx
this is only for status identification. so , we can easily identify which rows we have visited and edited. so, i am hoping that changes does not effect any feature or functioanailty.

You're correct - the changes we made earlier to track visited (yellow) and edited (green) row statuses are purely visual indicators and don't affect any functionality of the JSON editor. These changes only:

Track which rows have been visited using visitedRows state
Track which rows have been edited using editedRows state
Display different circle colors based on these states
The core features remain unchanged:

JSON validation
JSON editing
Data persistence
CSV export
Auto-save before browser close
Row selection
JSON formatting
The status indicators simply help users keep track of their progress through the rows, making it easier to know which rows they've already looked at and which ones they've modified.

still edited row status is not showing green. but when i visied any row it is showing yellow.

I notice that the issue is with the timing of setting the edited status. The setEditedRows is only being called in handleJsonChange, but we also need to track edits made through the JsonEditorComponent. Let's update the code to track edits in both places.

components/json-editor.tsx
This change will ensure that the row status turns green when edits are made through either the raw JSON editor or the structured JSON editor component. The visited status (yellow) will continue to work as before.
